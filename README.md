Just walked out of watching Bullet Train Explosion and, oh boy, what a ride. My brain feels like it’s just been shaken and stirred — like a soda can in a paint mixer, and I mean that both in the best and strangest ways possible.

First off, let me just say, they weren’t kidding with the title. Bullets, trains, and oh yeah, a lot of explosions. But you know, it wasn’t all bang-bang and kablooey... there was actual stuff happening in between. Characters, plot twists. Ok, maybe the plot was like trying to knit with spaghetti, a little messy but oddly satisfying? Like when you try a new makeup technique and it kinda works but you’re not totally sure what you did.

I couldn’t help but notice the lead’s eyeliner, though. How do they make it stay so perfectly smudged yet ‘intentionally undone’ looking while they dodge bullets? ‘Cause my eyeliner has abandonment issues — it’ll flake, fade, and flee as soon as I sneeze.

> The dialogue was sharp and sometimes so on-the-nose it felt like it was auditioning for a soap opera. But hey, maybe that’s the charm? Or maybe I’m just delirious from the sheer velocity of nonstop action, or possibly lack of caffeine during the film. 

I’m trying not to spoil anything but let’s just say there’s a moment involving a very unexpected item in the bullet train’s cargo. Oh my goodness, imagine finding a 90s boy band memorabilia box at the crash scene?! Well, not quite that, but you get the picture. I'd almost tell you to just download the movie to see the chaos unfold...but I don’t know if I should be encouraging that? Ah, who even knows these days.

[python]
def explosion_tally(scene):
    tally = 0
    if scene == dynamite_wagon:
        tally = 20
    print(Explosions in this scene:, tally)
[/python]

Anyway, by the time the credits rolled, I was almost too dazed to move, like waiting at the airport knowing your flight’s on another delay. Bullet Train Explosion was a weird, awesome rainbow of popcorn energy. Would I watch the movie again? Maybe on a weekend where I’m feeling overly ambitious or just really in the mood for some action-packed nonsensical entertainment. Gonna need a power nap to fully process this one.
